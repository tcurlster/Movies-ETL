# Movies-ETL

## Project Summary
The Movies ETL project is an example of extracting, transforming and loading data from multiple open source locations.  Within this project I pulled in data from 3 different locations, cleaned it so that it could be merged into 2 different SQL tables, removed unnecessary columns and finally loaded the data to those PostgreSQL tables so that it can be further analyzed.
